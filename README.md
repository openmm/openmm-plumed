OpenMM PLUMED Plugin
=====================

This project provides a connection between [OpenMM](http://openmm.org) and [PLUMED](http://www.plumed.org).
It allows you to bias or analyze an OpenMM simulation based on collective variables.

This plugin requires PLUMED version 2.3b or greater. OpenMM 8.1.0 or greater is required to use v2.0 of this plugin. For previous versions of OpenMM you may use v1.0.

Installing The Plugin
=====================

We provide [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) packages for Linux and MacOS via [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/), which can be installed from the [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openmm-plumed):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openmm-plumed
```

If you don't have `conda` available, we recommend installing [Miniconda for Python 3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to provide the `conda` package manager.  

Building The Plugin
===================

This project uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) for its build system.  To build it, follow these
steps:

1. Create a directory in which to build the plugin.

2. Run the CMake GUI or ccmake, specifying your new directory as the build directory and the top
level directory of this project as the source directory.

3. Press "Configure".

4. Set OPENMM_DIR to point to the directory where OpenMM is installed.  This is needed to locate
the OpenMM header files and libraries.

5. Set PLUMED_INCLUDE_DIR and PLUMED_LIBRARY_DIR to point to the directories where the PLUMED header
files and libraries are installed.

6. Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the directory where the plugin should be installed.  Usually,
this will be the same as OPENMM_DIR, so the plugin will be added to your OpenMM installation.

7. Press "Configure" again if necessary, then press "Generate".

8. Use the build system you selected to build and install the plugin.  For example, if you
selected Unix Makefiles, type `make install` to install the plugin, and `make PythonInstall` to
install the Python wrapper.

Using The Plugin
================

Simply create a `PlumedForce` object, passing the PLUMED control script as an argument to the
constructor, then add it to your `System`.  For example,

```Python
script = """
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
METAD ARG=d SIGMA=0.2 HEIGHT=0.3 PACE=500"""
system.addForce(PlumedForce(script))
```

Be aware that PLUMED numbers atoms starting from 1, whereas OpenMM numbers them starting from 0.
The example above performs metadynamics based on the distance between atoms 0 and 9 (in OpenMM's
numbering system).
